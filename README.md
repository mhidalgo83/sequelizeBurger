# sequelizeBurger

This app lets the user create and "devour" their own burger creations. The app uses a mySQL database to store user information. I also used the npm "method-override" to make interacting with the database a bit easier. The app also utilizes Sequelize to run fewer lines of code. Make sure that you run an npm install before you begin the app (all dependencies are in the package.json file).
